Problem Statement:
We are interested in calculating and visualizing the marginal probability distribution of the 
sum of two dice rolls. We want to analyze the likelihood of obtaining each possible sum value 
when rolling two fair six-sided dice.

Solution:
To calculate the marginal probability distribution and visualize it, we utilize a bar chart 
representation. The x-axis of the chart will denote the sum values, while the y-axis will 
represent the corresponding probabilities.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Probability distribution of rolling two dice
dice_outcomes = list(range(2, 13))
dice_probabilities = [0] * 11  # Initialize probabilities to 0

# Calculate the probabilities
for die1 in range(1, 7):
    for die2 in range(1, 7):
        sum_val = die1 + die2
        dice_probabilities[sum_val-2] += 1/36

# Plotting the bar chart
plt.bar(dice_outcomes, dice_probabilities)
plt.xlabel('Sum')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.title('Marginal Probability Distribution: Sum of Two Dice Rolls')
plt.xticks(dice_outcomes)
plt.show()
